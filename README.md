# Pose Estimation using OpenCV and Mediapipe

This Python program utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to perform pose estimation on input videos. It takes a video input and generates an output video with drawn pose landmarks overlaying the detected human poses. Additionally, it calculates and displays the frames per second (FPS) using the time and NumPy libraries.

## Features

- Pose estimation on input videos
- Draws pose landmarks on detected human poses
- Calculates and displays FPS
- Uses OpenCV and Mediapipe for efficient and accurate pose estimation

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Usage

1. Place your input video in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py --input_video your_input_video.mp4
```

3. The program will process the input video, perform pose estimation, and generate an output video with pose landmarks drawn.
